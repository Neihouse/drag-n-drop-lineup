# 🧪 **Internal Testing Guide**

## **Quick Role Switch Testing**

The app uses hard-coded constants for internal testing. Edit these in `seed/internalSeed.ts`:

```typescript
// Change these to test different views:
export const CURRENT_ROLE: UserRole = 'booker';     // promoter | booker | artist
export const CURRENT_ARTIST_ID = 'neihouse';        // neihouse | gobi | quietpack
```

### **🎛️ Role Behaviors**

| Role | Access | Features |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Promoter** | Full control | Lock/unlock lineups, all DnD |
| **Booker** | Build lineups | DnD enabled, no lock controls |
| **Artist** | View dashboard | Accept/decline slots, tech rider |
