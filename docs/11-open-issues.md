## **üí° Notes for Development Team**

### **Architecture Decisions**
- **localStorage ‚Üí Database**: Easy migration path designed from day one
- **Component-First**: All UI components are documented and reusable
- **Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript coverage prevents runtime errors
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance built-in, not bolted-on

### **Code Quality Standards**
- **ESLint + Prettier**: Consistent code formatting
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Maximum type safety
- **Component Documentation**: Props, states, and usage examples
- **Git Workflow**: Descriptive commits with feature branching

### **Testing Strategy**
- **Manual Testing**: Comprehensive user flow validation
- **Internal Dogfooding**: Real team members testing with actual data
- **Cross-Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari compatibility verified
- **Mobile Testing**: iOS Safari, Android Chrome responsive design

The platform is architecturally sound and ready for production with minimal additional development required. Focus should be on backend integration rather than frontend modifications.
