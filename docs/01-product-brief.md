# 🎵 **Primordial Groove - Lineup Management Platform**

## **Problem Statement**

Event promoters and bookers currently manage DJ lineups through fragmented workflows using spreadsheets, email chains, and manual calendar coordination. This leads to scheduling conflicts, communication gaps, and inefficient artist management. Our platform consolidates the entire lineup creation, artist communication, and event timeline management process into a single, real-time collaborative tool that scales from intimate club nights to multi-stage festivals.
