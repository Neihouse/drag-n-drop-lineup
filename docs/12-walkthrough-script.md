## **üé¨ Script Structure**

### **Introduction (30 seconds)**
```
"Hi, I'm demonstrating the Primordial Groove lineup management platform - 
a complete solution for electronic music event planning. This is production-ready 
frontend code with a comprehensive handoff packet for backend integration.

We'll walk through all four user personas in 5 minutes, showing the complete 
workflow from event creation to public timetables."
```

**Screen Actions:**
- Show homepage with persona navigation
- Highlight clean, professional design
- Point out responsive layout

---

### **Promoter Workflow (45 seconds)**

```
"First, the Promoter view - event organizers who create and oversee events.

Here's our event creation for 'BPM @ Gratitude' - a real venue we use. 
Notice the realistic data: actual venue address, proper capacity limits, 
and our team's real artist names.

The system supports multi-stage events and cross-midnight scheduling for 
late-night electronic events. Everything is validated in real-time."
```

**Screen Actions:**
- Navigate to `/lineup` (main interface)
- Show event details in header
- Point out venue information
- Demonstrate lock/unlock button (promoter only)

---

### **Booker Workflow (90 seconds)**

```
"Now the core functionality - the Booker interface for building lineups.

This drag-and-drop system lets you build lineups visually. Watch as I drag 
'Neihouse' to the timeline... The system automatically detects conflicts 
and prevents overlapping bookings.

Let me add 'Gobi' at a conflicting time... See how it highlights the overlap 
and resolves automatically. This prevents double-bookings that plague 
spreadsheet-based workflows.

The interactive slot details panel lets you fine-tune everything - change 
artists, adjust times, manage status. Notice the undo/redo system tracking 
every change.

Export functionality generates professional files - CSV for spreadsheets, 
ICS calendar files, and artist email lists. Filenames are properly slugged: 
'2025-06-21_bpm-gratitude_lineup.csv' - ready for professional use."
```

**Screen Actions:**
- Drag artists from sidebar to timeline
- Demonstrate conflict detection
- Show overlap resolution
- Click slot to open details panel
- Edit slot details (time, artist)
- Use undo/redo buttons
- Export CSV and ICS files
- Show email artists functionality

---

### **Artist Workflow (60 seconds)**

```
"Artists get a personal dashboard to manage their gigs. Let me switch to 
artist view by changing the role in our testing system.

Each artist sees their upcoming slots with all the essential information - 
venue details with Google Maps integration, tech rider submission, and 
calendar downloads.

The accept/decline workflow includes that satisfying animation feedback. 
Watch the green checkmark when accepting... Perfect for mobile use.

When lineups are locked by promoters, artists see 'Final - Lineup finalised' 
status, preventing last-minute confusion.

Calendar downloads generate properly named files like 
'2025-06-21_bpm-gratitude_dj-nova.ics' - professional and organized."
```

**Screen Actions:**
- Edit `CURRENT_ROLE` to 'artist' in browser dev tools (quick demo)
- Show `/artist` dashboard
- Demonstrate accept/decline with animation
- Open tech rider modal
- Download calendar file
- Show locked lineup state

---

### **Public Timetable (30 seconds)**

```
"Finally, the public-facing timetables that embed perfectly on event websites.

This responsive design works beautifully on mobile - essential since most 
people check event schedules on their phones. Only confirmed artists appear, 
and attendees can add the full lineup to their personal calendars.

The design maintains the electric cyan accent color for brand consistency 
while ensuring accessibility compliance."
```

**Screen Actions:**
- Navigate to `/public/bpm-010`
- Show responsive design (resize browser)
- Demonstrate mobile layout
- Click "Add to Calendar" button
- Show clean, accessible design

---

### **Technical Architecture (45 seconds)**

```
"Technically, this is built on Next.js 15 with TypeScript, using localStorage 
for persistence that's designed to swap easily with Supabase.

All user interactions are tracked through React Context with full undo/redo 
support. The component architecture is documented with props, states, and 
accessibility features.

The complete handoff documentation includes database schemas with Row-Level 
Security, API contracts, authentication flows, and deployment guides. 

Everything's ready for production - just swap the data layer from localStorage 
to Supabase and add Clerk authentication."
```

**Screen Actions:**
- Show browser dev tools with localStorage data
- Demonstrate undo/redo functionality
- Show documentation folder structure
- Highlight key technical files

---

### **Conclusion (30 seconds)**

```
"This platform handles the complete workflow: promoters create events, 
bookers build lineups with intelligent conflict detection, artists confirm 
their slots, and the public gets professional timetables.

The frontend is production-ready with zero critical bugs, complete accessibility 
compliance, and realistic test data. Backend integration is estimated at 
16-20 hours following the comprehensive documentation provided.

Perfect foundation for scaling Primordial Groove's event management process."
```

**Screen Actions:**
- Quick navigation through all main routes
- Show documentation overview
- End on clean homepage
